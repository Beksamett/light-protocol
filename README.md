# 🛰️ The Light Protocol

### A Global Infrastructure for Radical Transparency

The **Light Protocol** is an open-source framework for a decentralized, censorship-resistant platform designed to make the concealment of humanitarian crimes and resource scarcity structurally impossible.

## 📑 The Problem
The issue is not a lack of information—it is a lack of real-time, undeniable visibility for the right people at the right time. A primary example is the situation in Gaza (2024/25), where 171,000 tons of aid were documented at the border while 500,000 people faced starvation.

## 🛡️ The Three Pillars
1. **Real-Time Resource Tracking:** Fusing satellite imagery (Sentinel-1/2), ship tracking (AIS), and NGO data (UN OCHA HDX) to prove supply discrepancies.
2. **Peace-Focused Financial Forensics:** Linking arms transfer databases (SIPRI) with corporate records (OpenCorporates) to expose war profiteering.
3. **Manipulation Detection:** Cross-referencing political statements with verified field data to expose disinformation in real-time.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture
* **Storage:** Decentralized via **IPFS** and **Blockchain** (Ethereum/Filecoin) for immutability.
* **Verification:** A **Multi-Node Consensus** requiring confirmation from at least three independent nodes (NGOs, universities).
* **Access:** Optimized for **Tor**, satellite internet, and SMS-based access.
