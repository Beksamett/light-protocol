### A Global Infrastructure for Radical Transparency

[cite_start]The **Light Protocol** is an open-source framework for a decentralized, censorship-resistant platform designed to make the concealment of humanitarian crimes and resource scarcity structurally impossible[cite: 8].

## 📑 The Problem
[cite_start]The issue is not a lack of information—it is a lack of real-time, undeniable visibility for the right people at the right time[cite: 7]. [cite_start]A primary example is the situation in Gaza (2024/25), where 171,000 tons of aid were documented at the border while 500,000 people faced starvation[cite: 10].

## 🛡️ The Three Pillars
1. [cite_start]**Real-Time Resource Tracking:** Fusing satellite imagery (Sentinel-1/2), ship tracking (AIS), and NGO data (UN OCHA HDX) to prove supply discrepancies[cite: 13, 15, 16, 17].
2. [cite_start]**Peace-Focused Financial Forensics:** Linking arms transfer databases (SIPRI) with corporate records (OpenCorporates) to expose war profiteering[cite: 24, 26, 27].
3. [cite_start]**Manipulation Detection:** Cross-referencing political statements with verified field data to expose disinformation in real-time[cite: 30, 31].

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture
* [cite_start]**Storage:** Decentralized via **IPFS** and **Blockchain** (Ethereum/Filecoin) for immutability[cite: 35, 36].
* [cite_start]**Verification:** A **Multi-Node Consensus** requiring confirmation from at least three independent nodes (NGOs, universities)[cite: 40, 41, 42].
* [cite_start]**Access:** Optimized for **Tor**, satellite internet, and SMS-based access[cite: 39].
